      <h1>The beginners guide to the BAMC Language</h1>
      <p>
        This section is designed to help you get started with the BAMC Language
        even if you have little or no prior coding experience. We'll focus on
        simple, practical tasks and walk you through them step-by-step.
      </p>

      <p>Here, you'll find:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple explanations of what each command does.</li>
        <li>Examples that are easy to understand and copy.</li>
        <li>Tips for common tasks without needing complex coding.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your First Steps</h2>
      <p>
        Let's begin with some fundamental commands. Each command below shows you
        what to type and explains it in simple terms. Remember, you'll put these
        lines into your BAMC script file!
      </p>

      <div class="example-section">
        <h3>Script 1: Open a Browser and Visit a Website</h3>
        <p>
          This is how you tell your script to open a web browser and go to a
          specific internet address.
        </p>
        <pre><code>browser "chrome"
visit "https://www.google.com"
wait-for-seconds 5</code></pre>

        <div class="step">
          <strong>What each line does:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>browser "chrome"</code>: This line tells your script to use
              the Chrome browser to perform the actions. (You could also use
              <code>"firefox"</code> for the Firefox browser).
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>visit "https://www.google.com"</code>: This command opens
              your chosen browser and takes it to the Google website. You can
              change <code>"https://www.google.com"</code> to any website
              address you want to open!
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>wait-for-seconds 5</code>: This tells the script to pause
              for 5 seconds. This is useful to give websites time to fully load
              or for you to see what's happening.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>Try it yourself:</strong> Copy these lines into a .BAMC file
          and run it. Your browser should open, go to Google, and wait for 5
          seconds before closing (or moving to the next command if you add
          more).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="example-section">
        <h3>
          Script 2: Visit a Website and Take a Screenshot (wikipedia.bamc)
        </h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes you want to save a picture of what's on the screen. This
          script shows you how to do just that.
        </p>
        <pre><code>browser "chrome"
visit "https://www.wikipedia.org"
wait-for-seconds 2
take-screenshot "wikipedia.png"</code></pre>

        <div class="step">
          <strong>What each line does:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><code>browser "chrome"</code>: Starts Chrome.</li>
            <li>
              <code>visit "https://www.wikipedia.org"</code>: Goes to the
              Wikipedia website.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>wait-for-seconds 2</code>: Waits for 2 seconds to ensure the
              page loads.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>take-screenshot "wikipedia.png"</code>: This command takes a
              picture (a "screenshot") of your browser screen and saves it as an
              image file named <code>wikipedia.png</code> on your computer. You
              can open this image file later to see what was on the screen.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>Try it yourself:</strong> Run this script and check the folder
          where your BAMC script is saved for the "wikipedia.png" image file!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="example-section">
        <h3>Script 3: Searching for Deals on eBay (ebay.bamc)</h3>
        <p>
          This script shows you how to open eBay, type something into the search
          bar, click the search button, and then save the results page to your
          computer.
        </p>
        <pre><code>browser "chrome"
visit "https://www.ebay.com/"
wait-for-seconds 1.5
fill-text "#gh-ac" "Awesome deals"
wait-for-seconds 1
click "#gh-search-btn"
wait-for-seconds 10
save-as-html "ebay-search.html"</code></pre>

        <div class="step">
          <strong>What each line does:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>browser "chrome"</code>: This line tells your script to use
              the Chrome browser.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>visit "https://www.ebay.com/"</code>: This command opens the
              eBay website in the browser.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>wait-for-seconds 1.5</code>: A short pause to help the page
              load.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>fill-text "#gh-ac" "Awesome deals"</code>: This is how your
              script "types" into a box on a website.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>"#gh-ac"</code> is what's called a
                  <a href="advanced_docs.html#selectors">selector</a> (Don't
                  worry too much about how these work for now, just know they
                  point to specific parts of a webpage!)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>"Awesome deals"</code> is the text your script will type
                  into that search box.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>wait-for-seconds 1</code>: A single second pause after
              typing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>click "#gh-search-btn"</code>: This command "clicks" on
              something.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>"#gh-search-btn"</code> is the
                  <a href="advanced_docs.html#selectors">selector</a> for eBay's
                  search button.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>wait-for-seconds 10</code>: We wait a bit longer here to
              make sure the search results page loads completely after clicking
              the button.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>save-as-html "ebay-search.html"</code>: After the search,
              this command saves the entire webpage you're currently looking at
              as an HTML file named <code>ebay-search.html</code> on your
              computer. You can open this file later in your web browser to see
              the results.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>Try it yourself:</strong> Copy this script into a BAMC file,
          run it, and see if you get an "ebay-search.html" file with your search
          results!
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Where to Go Next</h2>
      <p>You've now seen some foundational things your BAMC scripts can do!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Experiment:</strong> Change the websites, the text you type,
          or the search terms in these examples.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Combine:</strong> Try to put different commands together to
          create your own unique scripts.
        </li>
        <li>
