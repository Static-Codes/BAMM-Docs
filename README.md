# Browser Automation Master 🤖

A custom scripting language that compiles into Python 3.9+ code.

Selenium automation in Python can involve a lot of repetitive code and detailed setup. BAM simplifies that process by allowing you to write automation scripts in a more concise, readable, and English-like language. This script is then passed to the compiler, which generates a Python file, effectively reducing the amount of boilerplate you need to manage.
